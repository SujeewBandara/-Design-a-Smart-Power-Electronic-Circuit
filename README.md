 Innovative Wave Energy Converter with Smart Power Electronics for Stable Energy Harvesting

## Introduction:
Our research focuses on advancing the field of wave energy harvesting through the development of a groundbreaking technology â€“ a Distributed Embedded Energy Conversion Technology (DEEC-Tec) that combines a wave energy converter, compressed air energy storage system, and the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) principle. This concept is introduced as a solution to address power quality issues associated with traditional OWC devices, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of wave energy conversion.

## Key Features of DEEC-Tec:
The DEEC-Tec prototype employs a wave energy converter with a compressed air energy storage system, utilizing the Oscillating Water Column principle. This innovative approach not only captures wave energy effectively but also mitigates power quality challenges commonly faced by OWC devices. The utilization of compressed air energy storage enhances the overall system's flexibility and reliability.

## Laboratory-Scale Testing:
A laboratory-scale device was developed and tested to validate the feasibility and functionality of the DEEC-Tec concept. The initial testing demonstrated the proper operation of the device; however, the generated output was noted to be suboptimal. In response, the research team provided recommendations for improvement, highlighting the commitment to refining the technology for real-world applications.

## Smart Power Electronic Converter Device:
In addition to the DEEC-Tec, our research endeavors include the development of a smart power electronic converter device designed specifically for sea wave energy harvesting. Recognizing the inherent variability in sea wave profiles, our device is engineered to handle dynamic frequency and voltage components. The converter comprises three main components: rectifier, regulator, and inverter.

 ## Functionality of the Converter:
The smart power electronic converter effectively eliminates unwanted frequencies and stabilizes the voltage output to a standard 230V and 50Hz. The circuit incorporates a Buck-Boost converter with a dynamically adjustable duty cycle controlled by a logic circuit. This enables the precise regulation of voltage levels, ensuring that any low voltages below the threshold are boosted to 12V. The 12V AC is then fed into a step-up transformer, resulting in a reliable and stable 230V output.

## Conclusion:
Our research represents a significant contribution to the field of wave energy conversion and distributed energy resources. The DEEC-Tec concept, combined with the innovative smart power electronic converter, showcases our commitment to addressing the challenges associated with sea wave energy harvesting. As we continue to refine and optimize our technologies, we aim to pave the way for sustainable and efficient wave energy utilization, making a positive impact on the renewable energy landscape. This research project is a testament to our dedication to advancing clean energy solutions for a more sustainable future.
